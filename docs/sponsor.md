# Sponsor

Both Craft.js and Reka are released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/prevwong/reka.js/blob/main/LICENSE) and are made with 100% love. In July 2022, I left my full-time job and in that time, I built the initial version of Reka.

If you found these projects valuable, and you would like to help me out - please consider sponsoring/donating to the project. Your contribution would mean a lot to me!
